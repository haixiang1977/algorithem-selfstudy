// A heap is a way to organize the elements of a range that allows for fast retrieval of the element
// with the highest value at any moment (with pop_heap), even repeatedly, while allowing for fast insertion
// of new elements (with push_heap).
// The element with the highest value is always pointed by first.
// The elements are compared using operator< (for the first version), or comp (for the second)
// The standard container adaptor priority_queue calls make_heap, push_heap and pop_heap automatically to
// maintain heap properties for a container.
// API:
// make_heap Make heap from range
// push_heap Push element into heap range
//     used to insert elements into heap. The size of the heap is increased by 1. New element is placed appropriately in the heap.
// pop_heap Pop element from heap range
//     used to delete the maximum element of the heap. The size of heap is decreased by 1. The heap elements are reorganised accordingly after this operation.
// sort_heap Sort element of heap
//     used to sort the heap. After this operation, the container is no longer a heap.
//     if want to be heap, needs to make_heap again
// reverse Reverse range
