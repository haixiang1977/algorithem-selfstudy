A heap is a data structure that has the form of a tree and that respects the heap property, namely: every node must be lower than each of its children.

In a heap, each node can theoretically have any number of children.
But in the STL, heapsâ€™ nodes have two children, so by heap we will designate binary heaps in this article.

This is how the STL represents heaps: a heap can be stored in an std::vector for example, with the elements laid out next to each other like above.
