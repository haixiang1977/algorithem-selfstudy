shortest path algorithm
    example: a scheduling algorithm identify a flight with the fewest intermediate stops
    graph breadth first search algorithm

minimum path algorithm
    weighted graph
    example: network graph use weight to represent the volumn of traffic between nodes
    dijkstra algorithm, which idenfity the minimum sum of weights in moving from start vertex to end vertex
    minimum spanning tree algorithm is more general to connected undirected graph
